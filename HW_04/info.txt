[Candidate Reviews]

(100pt) Modify the Candidate Reviews application you developed in the previous homework so that it stores data in a database instead of in the application scope.

All features described in previous assignments must work; otherwise you may not receive any credit.
In addition to the application source code, please turn in an SQL script file hw4.sql which contains the statements to create and populate all the tables in the database.
