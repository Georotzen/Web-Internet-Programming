1. Create an HTML page Faculty.html that looks like what's shown in the picture below:

Faculty.png

Note that

Please use border="1" and cellpadding="2" for the <table> -- we'll be more HTML5-compliant later after we learn CSS.
Clicking on the Add Faculty link should take the user to the AddFaculty.html page described in the next exercise.
You may find the faculty information on the ECST Home Page under the menu Faculty/Staff -> ECST Faculty.
2. Create an HTML page AddFaculty.html that looks like what's shown in the picture below:

AddFaculty.png

Note that

You may omit the action and method attributes of the <form>.
The form fields should be placed inside a table so they are properly aligned.
The dropdown list should include three entries: Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Civil Engineering.
Clicking on the ECST Faculty link should take the user back to the Faculty.html page described in the previous exercise.
3. Upload both Faculty.html and AddFaculty.html to your CS3 account and make sure they work properly on CS3.

4. Create another HTML file lab3.html which contains a hyperlink to your Faculty.html page on the CS3 server, and upload all three HTML files to CSNS.
