1. (20pt) Add JavaScript code to Add.html so that if a user enters two numbers and clicks the Add button, the page displays the sum of the two numbers.

HINT:

Use attribute selector to select the <input> elements
Use .val() to get the user input value.
Use the JavaScript function Number() to convert the input value to a number. E.g. Number("") returns 0 and Number("1") returns 1.
Use an id selector to select the <span> element, and use .html() or .text() to set its content.
2. (60pt) Add JavaScript code to DollarConvert.html so it converts an amount in dollar to another currency. In particular, the converted amount should be updated as the user types the dollar amount, and it should also be updated whenever the user selects a different currency.

HINT:

 Add event handlers to the keyup event of the input field and the change event of the dropdown list.
.val() can be used on a <select> element to get the value of the selected option.
