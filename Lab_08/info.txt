1. Create a web application that consists of a HelloServlet servlet and a HelloJSTL.jsp as described in the lecture notes. Deploy the application on the CS3 server so that the servlet and the JSP page can be accessed through the following URLs, respectively:

http://cs3.calstatela.edu:8080/username/HelloServlet
http://cs3.calstatela.edu:8080/username/HelloJSTL.jsp
Note that username should be your account name on the CS3 server, e.g. cs3220stu31.

2. Create an HTML file lab8.html which contains the hyperlinks to your servlet and JSP page on the CS3 server. Upload lab8.html, HelloServlet.java, and HelloJSTL.jsp to CSNS.
