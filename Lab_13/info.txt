Please deploy your application on CS3, and upload all source files to CSNS. The source files should include all the source code, documentation (optional), and an HTML file lab13.html which contains a hyperlink to your application on the CS3 server. Note that file uploading will be disabled automatically after the due time, and late submission will not be accepted. Please do not change the files uploaded to CS3 after the due time - doing so will be considered cheating.

1. Create a Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse. Download rates.txt and save it under the /WEB-INF folder of your project. This file contains the conversion rates from one US dollar to several other currencies. For example, 1 US dollar equals to 0.942 Euro (EUR) or 0.805 British Pound (GBP).

2. CurrencyConverter.java is a servlet that helps people calculate currency conversions based on the rates in the rates.txt file. Add this servlet to your project, run it and see how it works.

3. (60pt) Modify the Currency Converter application so it uses the MVC architecture. In particular,

Requests should always be sent to controllers, not directly to views.
Servlets do not generate HTML content.
No Java code in JSP, i.e. no JSP expression (<%= %>), JSP scriptlet (<% %>), or JSP declaration (<%! %>).

4. (+10pt) For extra credit, use <fmt:formatNumber> to format the conversion result so it always shows three digits after the decimal point.
