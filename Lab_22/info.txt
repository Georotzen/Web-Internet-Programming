Please deploy your application on CS3, and upload all source files to CSNS. The source files should include all the source code, documentation (optional), and an HTML file lab22.html which contains a hyperlink to your application on the CS3 server. Note that file uploading will be disabled automatically after the due time, and late submission will not be accepted. Please do not change the files uploaded to CS3 after the due time - doing so will be considered cheating.

(100pt) Implement Edit Entry function for the GuestBook example using AJAX. The Edit Entry user interface is the same as the one you implemented in the last lab - a user may double-click on a table cell to edit its content; the difference, of course, is that this time you need to save the changes to server. If you didn't complete the last lab, you may use the code in Grades (Solution).html.
