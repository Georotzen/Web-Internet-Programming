TechBargains is one of my favorite websites. In this lab you are going to create a web page that mimic the layout of TechBargains. Please check out the two linked images below to see how your web page should look like:

Image 1: the top of the page
Image 2: after a user scrolls to the bottom of the page

Specifically:

*The page has a header (site title and a menu) and a footer. Note that the header stays at the top of the page when the page is scrolled.
*The main content of the page uses a two-column layout, with the left column taking up roughly 2/3 of the page width, and the right column taking up about 1/3.
*There is an advertisement block at the top of each column. Each ad block should have a yellow background and a minimum height of 200px.
*Make sure that you use appropriate fonts, borders, and spacing for the various elements in the page.

1. You can download mybargains0.html which contains the skeleton text and structure for the page. Rename the file to mybargains.html, and add a stylesheet to the page to format it as required. You may change the content of the HTML file.

2. Upload mybargains.html and the style sheet to your CS3 account and make sure they work properly on CS3.

3. Create another HTML file lab6.html which contains a hyperlink to your mybargains.html page on the CS3 server, and upload all HTML files and the style sheet to CSNS.
